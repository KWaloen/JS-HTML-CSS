# Messing around with JavaScript, HTML, CSS

This is my record of practicing with JavaScript with using online resources. I started messing with JavaScript in 2022 with zero programming experience while I was a job seeker during the COVID19 pandemic. I started by following the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms online courses. The work I did the can be found in the "JS practice from 2022" directory.

I have started to brush up on my JavaScript now in 2024. Stay tuned!
